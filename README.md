# AI-voice-assistant
Project Description
The AI Voice Assistant is an interactive voice-controlled application designed to help users perform various tasks efficiently through natural language processing and speech recognition. Utilizing Python libraries such as speech_recognition, pyttsx3, pywhatkit, wikipedia, and requests, the assistant can understand and respond to user commands, making it a versatile tool for daily tasks.

Key Features
Voice Interaction: Users can communicate with the assistant using natural speech, making it user-friendly and accessible.

Time Reporting: The assistant can tell the current time and date on request.

Web Search: Users can perform Google searches and Wikipedia queries by simply speaking their questions.

Weather Updates: By specifying a city, users can get current weather conditions, including temperature and weather descriptions.

Application Control: The assistant can open various applications like Notepad and Calculator based on user commands.

Music Playback: Users can request specific songs to be played on YouTube.

Simple Calculations: The assistant can perform basic mathematical calculations.

Reminders: Users can set reminders, which can be expanded into more complex scheduling features in future versions.

General Knowledge: The assistant can provide brief summaries of topics using Wikipedia, enhancing user knowledge on various subjects.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for the application.
Speech Recognition: For converting speech into text commands.
Text-to-Speech (TTS): To convert responses into spoken audio.
Web APIs: To fetch information such as weather data and Wikipedia summaries.
Regular Expressions: For command parsing and processing user input.
Future Enhancements
User Customization: Allow users to customize voice options and assistant behavior.
Calendar Integration: Enable scheduling and calendar management features for reminders.
Error Handling and Logging: Implement robust error handling and logging for better user experience and debugging.
Extended Functionality: Integrate additional APIs for news updates, messaging, and more complex queries.
